# Data_analysis

A collection of my **data analysis practice work in Python**, organized by weeks/days.  
Focus: cleaning, exploration (EDA), visualization, and basic modeling using Jupyter/Python.

> Repo structure currently includes folders like `week2/day7` and `week5/day7` (more will be added).

---

## Contents

- `week2/day7/` — analysis exercises from week 2, day 7  
- `week5/day7/` — analysis exercises from week 5, day 7  

Each folder typically contains notebooks/scripts + any supporting files needed for that day.

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib (and/or Seaborn)
